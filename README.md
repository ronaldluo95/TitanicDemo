### Readme

- This is a personal project by Ronald Luo. Feedback is welcome.
- This demo aims to cover a general understanding of the machine learning modeling process. 
- In the real world, things are flexible.
- The code in this demo may not be the most elegant but it can do the job.

- Some useful courses I took:
   - *Coursera: Applied Machine Learning by UM*
   - *Coursera: Python for Statistic by UM*
   - *Khan Academy: statistic and probability*
- A helpful book for this project:
  - *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow*
