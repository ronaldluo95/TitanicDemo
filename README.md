### Readme, please

- This is a personal project by Ronald Luo. Feedback is welcome.
- This demo aims to give you a general understanding of the machine learning modeling process. Machine learning is big, it is almost impossible to cover everything in a single notebook. But the ideas behind the process remain.
- In the real world, things are flexible. That means the process will be likely different from this demo. Some of the sessions may be skipped, while some will be far more deeper and comprehensive.
- Copy and paste is okay, but DON'T do it if you really want to improve. Take the class, write the code, take note of the lesson, any of these will benefit you more than Ctrl C + V.
- The code in this demo may not be the most elegant but it can do the job.

- Some useful courses I took, and you should definitely take a look at it:
   - *Coursera: Applied Machine Learning by UM*
   - *Coursera: Python for Statistic by UM*
   - *Khan Academy: statistic and probability*
- A book your may want to read as well:
  - *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow*
