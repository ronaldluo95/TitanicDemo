# TitanicDemo

### This notebook has 4 parts:

#### 1.Statistical analysis of the dataset. We will analyze some basic information of the Titanic dataset (mean, standard deviation, correlation etc.). This will give us an understanding of what are some of the important features of our prediction model.
#### 2.Visualization. We will use visualization libraries to directly show what is going in in this dataset. Numbers are hard to understand, but not graphs :p
#### 3.Data cleaning and transformation. The dataset is not clean; it has lots of null values, redundant columns and data points that make no sense. Therefore, to have the best accuracy of our prediction model, we need to handle this properly.
#### 4.Model building. We will use sklearn to test different algos, decide the best one, and further improve it.

*Note: Until the date below, I am still updating this documentation and the code. Let me know if you have any ideas regrading how to improve this model. Cheers.*
